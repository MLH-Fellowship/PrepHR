## What is PrepHR? 📝
An open source project to help students prepare for virtual pre-recorded interview.

## Why use PrepHR? 🤔
<b>Ever felt unprepared for talking to a camera? Do you feel weird while recording a HireVue video? Ever felt clueless before a behavioural interview? PrepHR is here to help.</b>
* Many companies have online HR interviews for the candidates in a way that needs the candidate to send recorded videos as answers to questions provided to them in a stipulated duration. Others involve presence of an interviewer.
* These platforms consider various parameters such as eye-contact, posture, confidence, expressions etc.
* Candidates have a hard time preparing for such interviews, and in many cases fail to understand where exactly they lack.
* It also feels unnatural to talk to a camera and candidates may lack expressions as a result.
